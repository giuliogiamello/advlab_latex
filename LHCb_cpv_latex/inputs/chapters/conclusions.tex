The aim of this experiment was to search for evidence of CP violation in the decay of charged $B^{\pm}$ meson into three kaons $K^{\pm}$.
the research was conducted using simulated and real dataset from the LHCb detector from 2011.

Through the use of Dalitz plots background events (decays through a charmed resonance) in the real data have been individuate and eliminate, leading to the identification of the kinematic regions where particles and antiparticles behaved in a distinctively different way. The CP asymmetry was calculated both globally and locally over these kinematic regions.

Although the significances of these results might make them out to be observations or discoveries, if we to consider other sources of uncertainties (e.g. the \emph{production asymmetry}), we obtain only evidence.

Concluding, a more precise analysis could be conducted by taking into account such uncertainties: in fact, we could calculate the contribution of background events to the signal peak using mass sidebands or by fitting the mass distributions, in order to obtain a more precise estimation of the yield of signal and background events.
